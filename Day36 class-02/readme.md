 _Here I get to know about GSAP scrollTrigger and few properties of it..._

 1. _***scrollTrigger:"class/id"*** when ever user will hit the trigger of that element animation will happen.._
 2. _***scrollTrigger:{}*** this curly braces can hold few properties, like.._
            _**trigger: "class/id"** (class name or tag name or id name, but you need to use parents id/class/tag whenever you will use pin)_ 
            _**scroller: "body"** (depends on case and demands basically it's parent indicator)_ 
            _**markers: true/false** (boolean value to get the visual marker on viewport)_
            _**start: "top"/"bottom"** (marking the animation triggers)_
            _**end: "top"/"bottom"**(end-point of animation triggers)_
            _**scrub: true/false/ 1 to 5** (boolean or number between 1(less smoother) to 5(smoothest peak))_
            _**pin: true/false** (pin element based on trigger)_
